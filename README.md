# CiviConnect Demo (cxnapp)

This is a demonstration app that accepts registrations using the CiviConnect
protocol.  Sites may register with the demo app, and then the app
administrator may issue adhoc commands via Civi's APIv3.

The app is built with Symfony 2 and the civicrm-cxn-rpc library. It may be
used as a base for developing more substantial applications.
